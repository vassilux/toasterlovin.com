I'm Rico. I'm a web developer.

At least I was when I wrote this, but being a web developer isn't the final destination for me; it's just a waypoint along the way toward mastering Computation, and I'm getting better so damned quickly that I don't know what I'll be by the time you read this. Web developer is a nice, well understood label though, so let's stick with that for now.

Two years ago, all I knew about making software was some stuff from a couple of classes I had taken in college. Then, after nine years of laying dormant, Computation found it's way back into my life. It started with some formulas in Excel. Then it was some HTML, CSS & PHP. Then it was some Perl.

Now, two years later, I've just finished my first Ruby on Rails app. I've learned a lot in the last two years, but I'm just getting started. This website is a kind of record of my journey to becoming great at making software.
