I recently read a blog post by [Jason Rudolph][jason] about [leveling up as a software developer][level-up]. To paraphrase him, the idea is to:

>1. Identify the experiences that advance a person as a developer.
>2. Select a particular experience to pursue.
>3. Pursue that experience to completion. (Achievement unlocked!)
>4. Reflect on that experience. Really soak it in.
>5. Return to Step 2, this time selecting a new experience.

This was along a common vein with some things I had been doing, and generally seemed like a good fit for me, since [I'm fairly new to programming][returning-to-computation], so I forked [his list][jason-list] and [modified it][my-list] to suit my circumstances:

###Program in a variety of different [programming paradigms][paradigm]###

* Write an application in a functional language
* Write an application in an object-oriented language
* Write an application in a prototype-based language
* Write an application in a logic programming language
* Write an application using the Actor model
* Write an application in Forth

###Program for different platforms:

* Write a nontrivial web app
* Write a nontrivial desktop app
* Write a nontrivial mobile app

###Enhance my understanding of the building blocks:

* Use machine learning to solve a problem
* Write a networking client (e.g., HTTP, FTP)
* Write a B-tree database
* Wrap an existing library to provide a better user experience
* Write an application or framework that provides a plugin model
* Write a testing framework
* Write a lexer & parser

###Enlighten myself:

* Complete five [code katas][kata]
* Complete the [programming koans][koan] for a language that you want to learn
* Attend a [code retreat][retreat]
* Read [SICP][scip] and complete all the exercises

###Program in the open:

* ~~Contribute to an open source project~~ ([Added three words of documentation][first-commit]. Ha!)
* Have a patch accepted at an open source project
* Earn commit rights on a significant open source project
* Publish an open source project
* Perform a [Refactotum][refactotum] of an open source project

###Learn by teaching others:

* Present a lightning talk
* Present at a local user group
* Present at a conference
* Publish a tutorial
* Publish a constructive code review of an open source project

EDIT: I have since [updated this list][revisited].
