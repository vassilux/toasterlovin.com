I recently read a blog post by [Jason Rudolph][jason] about [leveling up as a software developer][level-up]. To paraphrase him, the idea is to:

>1. Identify the experiences that advance a person as a developer.
>2. Select a particular experience to pursue.
>3. Pursue that experience to completion. (Achievement unlocked!)
>4. Reflect on that experience. Really soak it in.
>5. Return to Step 2, this time selecting a new experience.

This was along a common vein with some things I had been doing, and generally seemed like a good fit for me, since [I'm pretty new to programming][returning-to-computation], so I forked [his list][jason-list] and modified it to suit my circumstances.
