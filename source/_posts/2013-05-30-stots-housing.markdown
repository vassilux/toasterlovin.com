_The second part in an [ongoing examination of the State of the 'Stash][stots] (StotS)._

If there's one overriding theme in [Mr. Money Mustache][mmm]'s approach toward housing, it is to [be deliberate about where you live][mmm-housing]. He thinks you shouldn't live in a place simply because it is near where you grew up. Instead, you should _choose_ an affordable place that will foster your pursuit of happiness.

He also thinks your primary considerations should be cost, proximity to work, proximity to outdoor recreation, and the happiness that a home will bring you, rather than it's size or the status you think it will bestow upon you. And, finally, he would [strongly advise you to repair and improve your own home][mmm-home-repair], instead of hiring professionals to do so for you.

So, how does our family compare to the Mustachian ideal when it comes to housing?

<!-- more -->

Not great, overall. We are getting one big thing right, though: we have already shown a willingness to uproot in pursuit of a better place. So, we had the right idea, we just got the implementation wrong.

About a year ago, we left Los Angeles in search of greener pastures in Northern California. We left LA because it is a [vast][la-sprawl], [expensive][la-real-estate], and [smoggy][la-smog] place and I work from home, so we were not tethered there financially.

So far, so good.

Here's where things go bad. We traded up from a $1000/month, 1 bedroom apartment to a $1750/month, 3 bedroom townhouse. That, in and of itself, is not _necessarily_ a bad thing. In fact, I work from home, my wife is a homemaker, and we're all around homebodies, so we use every room in our home every day.

Where we messed up is not in the size of our home, but in choosing the city we live in. Benicia is a quaint town within the [San Francisco Bay Area][sf-bay]. And therein lies the problem: it's kind of an expensive place to live. Not compared to Los Angeles or San Francisco, which is why I thought it so cheap when we first considered moving, but, compared to the rest of the country, it's pricey.

And, in case it slipped past you, I work from home, which means we can live wherever the hell we want, including places where a 3 bedroom townhouse doesn't cost $1750 per month. So, mistake number one.

The next issue with our housing situation is where, in Benicia, we live.

Benicia is one of the older cities in California, so it has a Main Street area with quaint, older homes, parks, access to a waterfront, and short blocks arranged in a [grid layout][grid-layout]. The result of this combination is an irresistible urge to get outside and walk around. It's quite marvelous and the reason we decided to move here.

But Benicia also has an area which is your typical suburban American experience where there are no visible signs of life and every street is either a cul-de-sac or a high speed artery. Since cul-de-sacs are boring as shit to walk on and high speed vehicle traffic is jarring to the senses, and you don't get to know any of your neighbors, the result is an overwhelming urge to not leave the house unless surrounded by the protective barrier of an automobile.

Guess which part of town we ended up in.

The wife had a good experience with suburbia while growing up in Canada, mostly due to a lovely grid-based street system, but also partly due to the kind and neighborly spirit of those Northern People. As a result, when it became clear that we would find more house for less price in the suburban area, she was deceived into thinking that was the better choice. I, being a city boy, was intensely skeptical of a place so apparently devoid of life, but I was swayed in the end.

We both regret it now. Our daily walk is a keystone of our life. It is 60 minutes of pure, uninterrupted communication. Sometimes it's serious, sometimes it's not, but we've come to consider it vital to functioning as a couple. And the walking around here is terrible.

The no-car options are either go around the block 4 times or go on the noisy arterial street with the dangerous, unprotected crossings. So, instead, we end up driving to the park. Shamefully anti-Mustachian.

We've got some work to do. We've already started talking about moving to a lower cost city and we made a pact a while back to go either rural or older urban, but absolutely not suburban. However, changing your housing is a big endeavor, not something you can implement next week, so our horizon for making these improvements is still 6-8 months out.

There is much to consider and weigh in choosing a place to live, so there will probably be updates as we start doing research and making plans.
