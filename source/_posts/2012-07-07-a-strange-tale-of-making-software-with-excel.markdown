Actually, making software with Excel is a little stranger than that: functions are the only tool explicitly available to you. It's up to you to figure out how to create variables, loops, and procedures (If you're curious, individual cells are variables, rows are items in a collection, and columns are individual steps in a procedure).

It turns out that in Excel, [everything is a function][fp], [which isn't so strange to me now][sicp], but took some getting used to at the time.
