_The second part in an [ongoing examination of the State of the 'Stash][stots] (StotS)._

For most families, transportation means cars. The cars that your typical family buys and the manner in which they are used, when taken together, are [Mr. Money Mustache's][mmm] single favorite target for his [Divine Wrath][wrath]. A Mustachian family buys only the smallest _used_ car that fits their _actual_ transportation needs, then uses that car only when _absolutely necessary_, opting to use a bicycle or legs whenever possible.

That means new cars, luxury cars, SUVs and pickups are all off the table for most families. Basically, the car you get should be the car you would buy if cars and gasoline were both 10 times more expensive than they are now. For most families that means a used hatchback sedan and/or a used minivan, but never two of the same kind of car.

The other prong in the Mustachian approach to transportation is to aggressively reduce driving and replace it with bicycling. The single most effective way to accomplish this is to live within bicycling distance of work and then bike to work. This is the point at which Mr. Money Mustache would add the [obligatory comment about the other amazing benefits of using a bicycle][bikes].

So, how Mustachian is our family when it comes to transportation?

<!-- more -->

Fairly Mustachian. Living near work is one of the key tenets of [Mustachianism][mustachianism] and I live as close to work as possible; I work from home. Mr. Money Mustache's main reason behind this tenet is cost -- money spent commuting can add up to a huge amount over a lifetime. My reasons for not driving to work are a little different: I really enjoy being around my wife and driving a car is incredibly uncomfortable for me because I'm so tall. So, a few years back, after making myself essential at work, I arranged to start working from home.

We own a single, fuel efficient car -- a 2001 Toyota Echo -- which cost me $2400 used. In other words, we own the right kind of car, or close to it (it's not actually a hatchback), but how do we _use_ the car? Well, as I mentioned, I work from home, plus my wife is a full-time mom, the grocery store is nearby, and we're naturally homebodies, so driving is not part of our daily life.

That all being said, there is definitely room for improvement. A walking trip to the grocery store takes about an hour in total, which makes for a refreshing excursion when we walk to buy groceries, but it also means that using the car can be tempting, especially when we need something quickly. This temptation results in more car grocery trips than we would like.

We could just get our shit together and stop being wussypants, but there's a healthy, convenient, Mustache Approved alternative: a bicycle. If I really haul ass, a bike would cut the round trip time down to about 20 minutes, which should eliminate the aforementioned temptation to be a wussypants.

Unfortunately, we're quite some distance from most of the other places we need to get to semi-regularly, so a bike wouldn't really help with our other driving, but bikes _are_ fun to ride, so we plan to start going out as a family once the baby's large enough to pop in a bike trailer.

There is one other optimization we need to make in the short term: consolidating trips. We are currently quite undisciplined about this and will frequently find ourselves making a trip out to a neighboring city that we have just visited the week before. There isn't really much more to say about this; we basically just have to punch ourselves in the face and get our shit together.

So, to sum it up: I would say we're only about 80% of the way to Complete Mustransportation. We've got the big shit covered and we should be able to knock off the remaining low-hanging fruit in the next several months. After that, what remains are projects with a much lower return on invested time than the other projects we can spend our time on -- [hypermiling][hypermiling] and learning how to drive an automatic transmission.
