In September of last year I attended my first tech conference, [Golden Gate Ruby Conference][gogaruco], in San Francisco. I went expecting to meet some like-minded people and learn some Ruby stuff, but Fate had something else planned for me.

On the first day, I ended up eating breakfast at a table with two lady programmers. Then, on the second day, I ended up sitting next to another lady programmer for several sessions. In the end, while I did learn some Ruby stuff and meet some like minded people, those ended up being afterthoughts to what I really gained: an education in being a better person.

Coming across as a jackass
-
- I had seen a lot of these "women in tech" articles.
- I had a lot of undistilled thoughts.
- On the one hand, I thought this chauvinistic behaviour was terrible.
- On the other hand, I kind of thought, "why is this feminism stuff being shoved in my face?"
- Also, "I am a man, why should I care?"
- One of the lady programmers mentioned Rails Bridge.
- I actually asked, "Well, why should I care?"
- It didn't go well, I came across as a jackass.
- But I knew I wasn't a jackass, just being inarticulate

Getting schooled
-
- Figured out what I was really trying to ask
- I wanted to care. And I did.
- I was also confused.
  - I felt like this feminism stuff was saying I was a jerk
  - I felt like caring about feminism would be kind of patronizing
- I also was curious, because I care about marketing: what is the pitch to men? Why should they care?
- I came across one of the lady programmers later in the day
- Started asking her questions.
  - She said, no, feminism isn't saying I'm a jerk.
  - But that I did grow up with a "knapsack of privelege"
  - And I should just be away that other don't have that, or have a smaller knapsack
  - She also said that caring and helping (with, ie, Rails Bridge) is not condescending. It's just helping.
  - Most interestingly, she said the reason to care is because equal is the way the world should be.
- Ended up sitting next to another lady programmer
  - She got me thinking about gender and LGBT issues.
  - How difficult it is to be outside of the hetero-normative
  - I realized that all groups that aren't part of the middle of the Venn diagram face these issues.

Some realizations
-
- It isn't a zero-sum game; women fighting for equality doesn't mean men lose anything
- Just because I was born into privileged, doesn't mean I have done anything wrong
- Feminists, reasonable ones, are not saying that you should feel bad about being priveleged, just that, hey, they would like to be priveleged in the same ways.
- I read about this knapsack of privelege. It hit home.
- A lot of them applied to me. Especially, moving to a neighborhood or community with people of my color.
- Another interesting thing happened shortly after the conference: I had a baby. A girl.

What should I do?
-
- Be aware of the fact that not having to think about this is a privilege.
- Don't need to change the world.
  - If you want to, though, please get involved
  - Think of your duty as a metaphor: Conductors and resistors
  - There are these memes running around, jumping from host to host.
  - Conduct the good memes and resist the bad ones.
  - Be a conductor of equality; think good thoughts, try to consider others when you speak
  - Be a resistor of intolerance; hear some guys at a conference talking about strippers during lunch, say "hey, not cool"
  - That happened to me, I didn't say anything, which brings me to a final point:
  - If you make a mistake, don't sweat it too much; just do better next time.

Why should I care?
-
- Venn diagrams
- Many of us aren't in the middle of the Venn diagram
- Even if we are, we might one day not be.
- Or, we might be married to somebody who isn't.
- Or, one of our children might not be.
- Ultimately, the most important reason, the one that really matters, is because we have to make the world a better place.
- Great Greek proverb: "A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.
