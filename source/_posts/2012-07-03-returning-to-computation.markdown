I did _okay_ in those classes, but the concepts really stuck. They
altered the way my brain worked on a fundamental level. There was something about the way
you model real world objects and their relationships in a relational database that struck
me as fundmentally true. Ditto for modelling and decomposing work as variables,
conditionals and loops.

It should have been blindingly obvious at the time that I was meant to play with computation,
but, being young, I lacked both insight about myself and the wherewithal to make a plan and
stick with it. So in the intervening 9 years, while I worked on some other stuff (link to finding myself),
computation receded into the recesses of my mind.

blahdiblah
