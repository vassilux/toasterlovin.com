http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph

Skeuomorphism is just a design tool
  - like color, texture, form, typography
  - liek other design tools it can be used poorly
  - most examples people give are examples of poor design
    - not bc skeu, but because other stuff: bad metaphor

Where do we end ?
  - Buttons are skeumorphic
  - Dividers between content areas

The difficulty of context
  - jack of all trades vs. master of one: jack of all trades wins
  - what are computers? meta tools used to become other tools: http://paulgraham.com/tablets.html
  - The more tasks you can do on a device, the more of an issue context becomes
  - IRL, people have super high bandwidth informtaion giving them context, not on devices
