I [previously wrote][previously] about leveling up as a programmer. At the time, I had forked a [list of programming achievements][jason-list] originally belonging to [Jason Rudolph][jason] and left his list mostly intact.

That was a mistake on my part.

<!-- more -->

Most of his achievements are pretty high level -- the kind of stuff you achieve over the span of an entire career. While it's vitally important to poke your head above ground every once in a while and make sure you're headed in the right direction, it turns out that's not really what I need at the moment.

Instead, I'm looking to make a list that I will revisit every few weeks or so. For something like that, I find it's more useful to look at things I want to accomplish within a horizon of six months to a year.

So, with that all said, here's what [my list][my-list] looks like at the time of writing. I removed most of the high level stuff and added in a bunch of skills related to [Ruby][ruby] and [Ruby on Rails][rails].

###Become more fluent in Ruby

- Commit the [Ruby][ruby] syntax to memory
- Commit significant standard libraries to memory
- Utilize a metaprogramming technique in an app

###Become more fluent in Ruby on Rails

- Use [Haml][haml] in an app
- Use JavaScript in an app [the Rails way][rails-js]
- Use [Coffeescript][coffee] in an app
- Deploy an app with [Capistrano][capistrano]
- Implement background jobs in an app

- Commit ActiveRecord::Migration API to memory
- Commit ActiveRecord validation API to memory

###Learn by teaching others:

- Present at a local user group
- Teach at a [RailsBridge][railsbridge] workshop
- Mentor a new [Rails][rails] programmer
