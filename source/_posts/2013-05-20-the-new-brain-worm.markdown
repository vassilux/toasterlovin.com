A couple of weeks ago, while meandering my way across the Internet, something interesting happened. I came across a website that contained a set of ideas so potent that they have since burrowed into my mind and made a permanent home there. In other words, I have been infected with a new brain worm. There's something unusual about this one, though.

Most species of brain worm are parasites, designed to aggressively seek a host mind to infect, then bend that mind, and the human to which it belongs, toward their creator's purposes. Think fast food, cigarettes, TV, credit cards, etc.

But this one is different. Like it's parasitic cousins, it is virulent and aggressive, and it, too, wants to control my mind and direct my actions. But, instead of bleeding me dry to enrich its creator, it promises to bend me relentlessly _toward my own prosperity_.

For this reason, I welcome my new overlord, the brain worm known as [Mustachianism][mustachianism], and its creator, [Mr. Money Mustache][mmm].
